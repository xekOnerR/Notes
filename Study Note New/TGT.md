Me:   How about this analogy:   I walk to the entrance of a club and ask the bouncer if I can go in. The bouncer checks me out and lets me in and hands me a pass to the VIP room (issues a TGT). Once in the club, I approach the VIP room and show my pass (TGT) to the person keeping the riff raff out of the VIP room. He approves it, lowers the velvet rope and hands me a free drink card (the service ticket). I belly up to the bar and ask for a drink and hand over my free drink card (the service ticket). If it is genuine, I get my free drink. (the service I want to access).

That's a great analogy for the Kerberos authentication process! Let's break it down using your analogy:
Getting the Initial Pass (TGT):
•    Just like walking up to the entrance of a club, you approach the bouncer (Key Distribution Center) and ask if you can go in. The bouncer checks you out and decides if you're allowed in. If everything looks good, the bouncer gives you a special pass (Ticket Granting Ticket or TGT) that says you're allowed inside the club.
Getting Access to the VIP Room:
•    Once you're inside the club, you want to go to the VIP room, but there's another person guarding it (the server). You show them your TGT to prove you're allowed to access the VIP room. If the server sees that your TGT is genuine, they let you through and give you a special free drink card (Service Ticket) as a bonus.
Accessing the Free Drink:
•    Now that you have your free drink card (Service Ticket), you go to the bar and ask for a drink. You hand over your free drink card to the bartender (the resource you want to access). The bartender checks if your card is real. If it is, they give you your free drink, and you enjoy your time in the VIP room.
